# Power BI - Movies Data

I previously created a dashboard in Excel and thought it would be interesting to recreate the same dashboard in Power BI to compare the tools.

You can find my previous project dashboard here. 
The main purpose of the dashboard is to analyze movie data and gain insights into which movie, genre, actor, or director was the most successful from 2012 to 2016 in terms of box office revenue and ROI.
