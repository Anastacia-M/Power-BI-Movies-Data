# Power BI - Movies Data

I previously created a dashboard in Excel and thought it would be interesting to recreate the same dashboard in Power BI to compare the tools.

You can find my previous project dashboard here: [https://github.com/Anastacia-M/MovieData/tree/main](https://github.com/Anastacia-M/MoviesData) 

The main purpose of the dashboard is to analyze movie data and gain insights into which movie, genre, actor, or director was the most successful from 2012 to 2016 in terms of box office revenue and ROI.

I found that creating visuals in Power BI was very convenient and intuitive, thanks to its drag-and-drop interface and advanced visualization options. However, I did encounter some challenges with arranging these visuals on the screen, which can be improved for a smoother user experience. 

Please find the Movies Data.pbix file in the repository. A screenshot of the dashboard is provided below for reference.
